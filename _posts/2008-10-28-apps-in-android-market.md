The OI News Reader helps you get the latest news to your phone. The OI Shopping list allows you to keep track of your shopping items or create a ToDo list. And the OI Flashlight is a small application that allows you to find your way in the dark by keeping the devices backlight turned on.

Of course, there is also the ADC top 50 winner SplashPlay in the Android Market.
