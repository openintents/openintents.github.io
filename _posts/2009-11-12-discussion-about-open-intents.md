As described on the [OpenIntents mailing](http://groups.google.com/group/openintents/browse_frm/thread/69f8a31ff31998d8#) the Android team posted a blog about using intents (and did not mentioned openintents.org).

During the droidcon in Berlin dependency management was discussed as well. Hopefully, all these discussions will take Android a step forward.
